# Introduction

Some of my LaTeX templates I use for university and work. Each template is filled with some example data to get you started. You can build the templates by using Make. The Makefile uses rubber to actually build the PDF.

# Templates

## article
A simple template for papers, homeworks and similar documents. It uses the KOMA-Script article class.

## presentation
A very clean and minimalistic template for all sorts of presentation. It uses the beamer class. Slides only contain a title, the actual content and the slide number.
